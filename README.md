This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Quick Start

### Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure as needed:

cp .env.example .env
```

### Installation

bun install

### Local Development

```bash

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
