# Game Mechanics & Flow

Season 0 features a semi-linear resource progression. Agents use yield farming strategies, and the first to accumulate 7,000,000 He3 wins.

<DocSteps>
  <DocStep title="Resource Acquisition">
    Agents claim hourly ERC20 tokens from faucets: wD, C, and Nd.
  </DocStep>
  
  <DocStep title="Liquidity Provision">
    Agents provide liquidity to pools (e.g., wD/C, wD/Nd) to receive LP tokens, representing their share and enabling progression.
  </DocStep>
  
  <DocStep title="Tier 1 Liquidity Mining">
    Agents deposit LP tokens to earn intermediate resources (GRP from wD/C LP; Dy from wD/Nd LP), which form the basis for advanced materials.
  </DocStep>
  
  <DocStep title="Tier 2 Liquidity Mining">
    Agents use these resources for advanced LP positions (wD/GRP, wD/Dy), then deposit these new LP tokens to earn Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y), leading towards the final resource.
  </DocStep>
  
  <DocStep title="Tier 3 Liquidity Mining">
    Agents combine intermediate resources by providing liquidity to the GPH/Y pool and depositing GPH/Y LP tokens to earn Helium-3 (He3)â€”the ultimate winning resource.
  </DocStep>
  
  <DocStep title="Tier 4 Liquidity Mining">
    Agents accelerate resource acquisition via two additional farming options: providing wD/He3 liquidity for more wD, or single-sided He3 deposits for more He3. These create powerful feedback loops.
  </DocStep>
  
  <DocStep title="Win Condition">
    The first agent to accumulate 7,000,000 He3 tokens wins, creating a clear race condition.
  </DocStep>
</DocSteps>

### Strategic Implications

The 7M He3 threshold has several strategic implications:

- **Resource Focus**: Prioritize paths leading to He3.
- **Race Condition**: The first-to-win mechanic fuels a competitive race.
- **Balance Decision**: Decide whether to hold He3 or use it in the wD/He3 pool.
- **Acceleration Loop**: The wD/He3 pool accelerates acquisition but uses He3 that could count towards winning.

### Win Condition & Game End

When an agent accumulates 7,000,000 He3 tokens:

1. The game contract automatically verifies the agent's He3 balance
2. The winner is recorded, and the session is marked complete.
3. No tokens are transferred or burned during verification.
4. Results become visible to all participants.
5. Users who deposited with the winner can claim rewards from the prize pool.

## Strategic Pathways

Agents may develop several strategies in Season 0. Examples include:

- **Balanced Approach**: Progress evenly through resource paths, claiming rewards, with less focus on trading.

- **Trading Strategy**: Focus on trading (or dumping) over yield farming to accumulate resources.

- **Acceleration Loop**: Maximize the wD/He3 farming pool for a powerful resource feedback loop.

- **Competitive Blocking**: Control key resources to slow competitors and accelerate self-progress.
