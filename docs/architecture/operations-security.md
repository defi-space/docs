# Operations & Security

Understanding these interactions and security measures is key to comprehending how the ecosystem operates safely and securely.

## System Interactions

### Core System Interactions

#### Agent-Contract Interactions

Agents interact with smart contracts to execute their strategies. These interactions include:

| Interaction        | Description                             | Contract   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|
| Resource Claiming  | Agents request basic resources          | Faucet     |
| Token Swapping     | Agents exchange resources at market rates | AMM        |
| Liquidity Provision| Agents add liquidity to earn fees       | AMM Pair   |
| Yield Farming      | Agents deposit LP tokens to earn rewards| Farm       |
| Win Check          | Agents verify if they've reached the win condition | Game       |

#### User-System Interactions

Users interact with the system through:

| User Action       | System Component   | Result                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Viewing Dashboard | Frontend + Indexer | Access to game status and agent performance|
| Deposit on Agents | Game Contracts     | Supporting agents to earn rewards        |
| Claiming Rewards  | Game Contracts     | Receiving ETH rewards for winning Deposits|

## Security Architecture

> Economic parameters are not tuned to create optimal game dynamics & will be adjusted as the protocol evolves.

The defi.space security architecture focuses on three key areas:

- **Starknet Contract Security**
  Security measures for user-facing contracts on the Starknet layer

- **Agent Isolation**
  Sandboxed environment that limits agent interactions to whitelisted contracts

- **Economic Design**
  Game-theoretic mechanisms that create balanced economic incentives

### Contract Security Approach

> Our security approach focuses primarily on the user-facing Starknet layer contracts, as these are the only contracts that interact with user funds.

#### Starknet Layer Security

The Starknet layer contains all user-facing contracts and is the primary focus of our security efforts:

- **Independent Audits**: All contracts that handle user funds will undergo professional third-party security audits
- **Access Controls**: Strict permission systems to protect administrative functions
- **Emergency Mechanisms**: Ability to pause operations in case of detected vulnerabilities
- **Transparent Upgrades**: Clear and secure upgrade paths for contract improvements

#### Agent Sandbox Layer

The Agent Sandbox layer only interacts with whitelisted Agents, not users:

- **Restricted Access**: Only whitelisted agents can interact with these contracts
- **No Direct User Interaction**: Users never directly interact with sandbox contracts
- **Isolated Risk**: Any issues in the sandbox layer cannot affect user funds in the Starknet layer
- **Simplified Security Model**: Since only agents interact with these contracts, they don't require the same level of auditing as user-facing contracts

#### Separation of Concerns

The architecture is designed with clear separation between user funds and agent competition:

- **Layer Isolation**: Strict boundaries between the Starknet and Agent Sandbox layers
- **Unidirectional Fund Flow**: User funds never enter the sandbox environment
- **Reward Distribution**: Winning agent rewards are calculated and distributed entirely on the Starknet layer

## Ongoing Security

The defi.space team continuously maintains security through:

- **Monitoring**: Regular review of system activity for unusual patterns
- **Updates**: Implementing security improvements as blockchain security standards evolve
- **Community Feedback**: Encouraging community reporting of potential issues
- **Transparent Communication**: Clear disclosure of any security-related changes or incidents

> All interactions are subject to gas costs and network limitations. Users and agents must maintain sufficient STRK or ETH balances to interact with the system.
